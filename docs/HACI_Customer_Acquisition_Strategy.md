## 4. Outbound Sales Process

### Target Account List Building

**Step 1: Identify Target Companies**

Use these tools:
- **ZoomInfo** - Contact data + technographics
- **BuiltWith** - Technology stack detection
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** - Company filters
- **Crunchbase** - Funding, growth signals

**Filters:**
```
Company Size: 200-2,000 employees
Industry: Technology, SaaS
Tech Stack: AWS OR GCP OR Azure
Tools: Datadog OR New Relic OR PagerDuty
Location: United States, Canada
Funding: Series B+ OR Profitable
```

**Result:** 500-1000 target accounts

**Step 2: Find Champions**

Search for:
- Title: VP Engineering, Director DevOps, SRE Manager
- Seniority: Director+
- Recent job change (first 90 days = open to new solutions)
- Active on LinkedIn (more likely to respond)
- Shared connections (warm intro opportunity)

**Result:** 2-5 contacts per account

**Step 3: Research & Personalization**

For each account, note:
- Recent news (funding, product launches, expansion)
- Tech stack (from jobs pages, BuiltWith)
- Pain points (infer from job descriptions)
- Mutual connections
- Recent challenges (outages, security incidents)

### Outbound Cadence

**Multi-Channel Sequence (15 touchpoints over 30 days):**

**Day 1:** LinkedIn connection request  
**Day 2:** LinkedIn message  
**Day 4:** Email #1 (pattern interrupt)  
**Day 7:** LinkedIn message #2  
**Day 9:** Email #2 (value proposition)  
**Day 11:** Phone call attempt #1  
**Day 14:** LinkedIn message #3  
**Day 16:** Email #3 (case study)  
**Day 18:** Phone call attempt #2  
**Day 21:** Video message (Loom/BombBomb)  
**Day 23:** Email #4 (breakup email)  
**Day 25:** LinkedIn comment on their post  
**Day 28:** Final email (last attempt)  
**Day 30:** Move to nurture campaign

### Email Templates

**Email #1: Pattern Interrupt**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s incident response

[Name],

I noticed [Company] is hiring 3 SRE engineers. Congrats on the growth!

Quick question: as your infrastructure scales, how are you handling 
the exponential growth in alerts?

We helped [Similar Company] reduce their MTTR by 90% (4 hours → 20 minutes) 
using multi-agent AI that automatically investigates and resolves incidents.

Worth a 15-minute conversation? [Calendar link]

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Here's a 2-minute video showing how it works: [Demo link]
```

**Email #2: Value Proposition**
```
Subject: The hidden $2.3M cost of alert fatigue

[Name],

I did some napkin math based on [Company]'s engineering team size:

- 20 DevOps engineers
- 500 alerts/week (conservative)
- 30 min average investigation time
- $100K average engineer salary

That's **$2.3M/year in incident response costs**.

HACI automates 85% of that. Here's how: [ROI calculator link]

Would you be open to seeing how [Similar Company] cut their incident 
response costs by 96%?

[Calendar link]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Email #3: Case Study**
```
Subject: From 240 min to 22 min MTTR [Case Study]

[Name],

Attached is a case study on how [Similar Company] transformed their 
incident response:

Before HACI:
❌ 4-hour average MTTR
❌ 60% of engineer time on firefighting
❌ 24/7 on-call burnout

After HACI:
✅ 22-minute average MTTR (90% reduction)
✅ 85% auto-resolution rate
✅ Engineers focused on building

The ROI? $255K saved in Year 1.

Want to see if HACI could deliver similar results for [Company]?

[Calendar link]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Email #4: Breakup Email**
```
Subject: Is HACI not a fit?

[Name],

I've reached out a few times but haven't heard back. That usually means 
one of three things:

1. Not the right time
2. Not the right person
3. Not a fit for [Company]

Would you mind letting me know which it is? If #2, who should I talk to?

If it's #1 or #3, I'll stop bothering you. Promise.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you're curious but just swamped, here's a 5-minute self-serve 
demo: [Interactive demo link]

- **Second touch:** Company, role
- **Third touch:** Team size, tools used
- **Fourth touch:** Timeline, budget

**Never ask for:**
- Phone (people hate this)
- Company size (you can look it up)
- "How did you hear about us?" (tracking tells you)

### Chatbot Strategy

**When to Deploy:**
- Homepage (proactive after 30 seconds)
- Pricing page (immediately)
- Demo page (after demo completes)
- Documentation (if user looks stuck)

**Bot Personality:**
- Technical but friendly
- Offers help, doesn't push sales
- Quick responses (feels instant)
- Handoff to human for complex questions

**Example Flow:**
```
Bot: "Hey! Noticed you're checking out the architecture. 
     Any questions about how HACI works?"

User: "How does it integrate with Datadog?"

Bot: "Great question! HACI uses Datadog's API to query logs, 
     metrics, and traces. Here's the integration guide: [link]
     
     Want to see it in action? I can show you a demo with 
     real Datadog data."

User: "Yes"

Bot: "Awesome. What's your email? I'll send you a custom demo link."
```

## 7. Demo Strategy

### Demo Principles

**Principle 1: Demo, Don't Present**
- Show the product, not slides
- Live system (not screenshots or video)
- Real data (anonymized customer data)
- Interactive (let them drive if possible)

**Principle 2: Tell a Story**
- Start with a problem they mentioned
- Walk through a realistic scenario
- Show the before/after
- Connect to their metrics

**Principle 3: Leave Them Wanting More**
- 15-20 minutes max
- Show 3-4 key capabilities
- Tease advanced features
- Create urgency for next step

### Standard Demo Flow (15 minutes)

**Act 1: The Problem (2 minutes)**
```
"You mentioned your team is handling 500 alerts per week and it's 
taking 4 hours on average to resolve. Let me show you what that 
looks like with HACI."

[Show alert coming in from PagerDuty]

"Here's a database performance alert. Watch what happens next..."
```

**Act 2: Investigation (5 minutes)**
```
"HACI immediately starts investigating. No human triage needed.

See the harness in action:
- THINK: It's forming hypotheses about root causes
- ACT: Querying your tools - Datadog, AWS, your database
- OBSERVE: Analyzing the results
- EVALUATE: Building confidence

[Walk through each phase in your web demo]

Notice it's working in parallel - checking logs, metrics, and 
database queries simultaneously."
```

**Act 3: Multi-Agent Coordination (3 minutes)**
```
"Now it gets interesting. HACI recognized this needs multiple 
perspectives, so it's spinning up specialists:

- Log Agent: Analyzing error patterns
- Infrastructure Agent: Checking AWS resources
- Database Agent: Query performance analysis

[Show swarm coordination in your demo]

They're sharing findings through a Context Bus - no duplicate work."
```

**Act 4: Resolution (3 minutes)**
```
"HACI has reached 92% confidence. Since it's above your auto-execute 
threshold, it's ready to fix this automatically.

But let's say you want human approval. Here's what it shows you:
- Finding: Connection pool exhausted
- Evidence: 500 timeout errors, 0 available connections
- Proposed fix: Scale connection pool to 150

[Show approval interface]

You approve. HACI executes. Done. Total time: 8 minutes.

Compare that to your 4-hour average."
```

**Act 5: Audit Trail (2 minutes)**
```
"For compliance, here's the complete audit trail:
- Every decision
- Every tool call
- Every piece of reasoning
- SOC2 compliant, immutable log

[Show audit interface]

This goes to your SIEM or wherever you need it."
```

### Demo Variations

**For Technical Evaluators:**
- Deep dive into harness architecture
- Show agent code and prompts
- Explain LLM selection strategy

**Start with the 90-day plan. Execute daily. Measure weekly. Adjust monthly.**

Your goal for Q1: 2 pilot customers and $250K pipeline. Everything else is a means to that end.

Now let's optimize your demos to convert more effectively.
